A. GENERAL RULES
1. Wars can only be started via NF until two majors are at war with each other (this includes France as a major but not China).
2. The Western Allies and Soviets may not give each other military access. They are a team, but only in the sense of "the enemy of my enemy."  However, if the Axis invade any neutral that borders the Soviet Union except Poland, the minor will join the Allies.  In this case, the Soviets may obtain military access from that minor so they can help defend it. This does not allow the Soviets to stack units in the same province with either UK or US for joint defense. (Countries potentially affected by this are Sweden, Turkey and Persia.)
3. Countries may not exert political pressure on human opponents to change their alignment or prepare a coup against them.
4. The Allies may not act against the reoccupation of the Rhineland or the partitioning of Czechoslovakia.
5. If one or more minors are being played by a human player, they may not have more than 33% of MIC on aircraft production, nor more than 33% of MIC on tank/mech production (in-game production categories).
6. If a human player is controlling China, no Lend Lease may be sent to China, unless Japan declares war on the USSR.  In this case, the Soviet player may send Lend Lease to China, but even no more than 10%/month of the Soviet’s output of anything.
7. NAVs and Kamikazes must have a wing size of 100.
8. Ship refits may not fill empty slots with new modules that consume resources.
9. The maximum number of paratroop divisions that any country may deploy is limited to that country's level of paratroop technology, with 2 divisions permitted per tech level. Therefore 2 divisions are permitted at level 1, 4 divisions at level 2, etc.
10. Mines may not be laid by any country until it is at war with a major power (i.e., US, UK, USSR, Italy, Japan, Germany, and France until its capitulation). Once at war, mines may only be laid according to the following criteria:
    a. Mines may be laid off the coast of a hostile nation and in sea zones with no coastline at 
         any time. 
    b. Mines may be laid off the coast of a co-belligerent/faction member unless that coastline 
         is shared with a major power that is not in the war.
    c. Until Japan joins the war, the Allies are not allowed to lay mines in the area from the 
         Eastern Indian Ocean eastwards to the west coast of North and South America, unless 
         the European Axis powers have access to that region via naval docking rights, conquest, 
         or some other means.
11. In order to realistically represent convoys routes, the UK may receive basing rights from the USSR, if both are at war with a common enemy.
12. When using Grand Battle Plan land doctrine, any received expeditionary forces must not be used with more planning bonus than that which is ordinarily available to the nation sending the expeditionary troops.
13. The UK player may take control of all French divisions when Germany declares war on Poland. French divisions must stay in the continent they were located at the time they come under UK control. That is, African troops stay in Africa and continental France troops stay in Europe. If any French units leave France, the UK must return all divisions to France before Paris falls and France capitulates.
B. WARS – DOWs, FACTIONS & ANNEXATIONS
14. If during the Winter War Finland asks to join either the Allies or the Axis, their request must be declined.
15. The Axis may not invade and annex the traditional Axis minor allies, i.e. Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, unless those countries change alignment to something other than fascist (or non-aligned, which is how Romania begins the game). The same is true if one of those minors joins a faction other than the Axis.
16. All minor allies and puppets must be called into all wars, both offensive and defensive.
C. GERMAN & ALLIED FORTS
17. No forts may be built on either side of the Franco-Belgian border until the first spring or summer after France and Germany are at war with each other. 
      (“spring” = 4th week of March through 3rd week of June; “summer” = 4th week of June through 3rd week of September)
D. NATION-SPECIFIC RULES
1. JAPAN
18. Japan must form its own faction and has the same restrictions with respect to cooperation with the Axis that Comintern does with the Allies. (see General Rules above)
19. If Japan and the USSR have a NAP, and if either country maintains at least 24 divisions (minimum 6 line battalions) along the border with the other country, that country may not be DOW’ed before 1/1/42.  If either country maintains a minimum of 48 divisions, it may not be DOW’ed by the other before 1/1/43.
2. ITALY
20. With two exceptions, Italian fleets and TF’s may not leave the Mediterranean Sea until either Gibraltar or Suez is taken by the Axis.  The first exception is submarines, which can operate anywhere within their range. The second exception is that Italy may station one TF in East Africa, consisting of no more than 10 screens (DDs and CLs).
3. USA
21. The USA may not place more than 1 division on any of their smaller Pacific islands during peace time (that is, anywhere except Hawaii).
22. Prior to entering the war, the USA may not build more than 3 divisions for placement in the Philippines, using either American or Filipino templates. Also, the USA may not send the Philippines any Lend-Lease shipments before entering the war.
23. Regardless of WT or other considerations, the USA may immediately join the Allies if Moscow falls or if any port on the island of Great Britain is captured.
24. On 1/1/42, the USA is freed of all restrictions and may enter any and all existing wars either via invitation to faction or by using war plan NFs.
4. GERMANY & THE USSR
25. If Germany offers the research treaty to the Soviets, acceptance by the Soviets is optional.  However, if it is accepted then the M-R Pact must also be offered and accepted.  If the first treaty is rejected by the Soviets, then the M-R Pact becomes optional for both countries.
26. If the Republicans win the SCW and if the Soviets subsequently guarantee them, then Spain may not be attacked until the USSR is at war with Germany.  However, if Republican Spain is guaranteed by the USSR and joins the Comintern, then it is permitted attack them first, since it will still result in war with the USSR.  If the Nationalists win the SCW, then the Axis may not invade Spain at all.  They must either persuade them to join the Axis or leave them as a friendly but neutral neighbor.
27. Prior to war with Germany, Soviet aggressions are limited to those countries for which they get claims in the M-R Pact. In those cases, the USSR must first deliver the ultimatum to gain the claimed states and may only go to war if the ultimatum is refused.  Per rule #1, they may also start any wars that are allowed by NFs.
28. If the Soviets make a NAP with Japan, see rule #19.
